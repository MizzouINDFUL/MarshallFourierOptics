    "#### 1) Decoupling the PDEs\n",
    "Before we can decouple the PDEs, we need to make some broad assumptions about our medium of propagation. Without any motivation we assume the wave is propagating in a dielectric medium that is linear, isotropic, homogeneous, nondispersive, and nonmagnetic. While we wont really get into the consequences of these assumptions here, rest assured these assumptions are valid for free space propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decouple the PDEs we take the curl of Faraday's law and simplify with the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{E}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E}) - \\nabla^2 \\vec{E}$, Ampere's law, and Gauss's law assuming no charge density: \n",

    "which is the vector wave equation. Notice that we started with a system of first order coupled partial differential equations, and we have now arrived at a second order (un-coupled) partial differential equation. There is one final simplification that is typical in most textbooks. We first need to define the index of refraction $n = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}}$ and the speed of light $c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0}}$. Substituting in, we arrive at the 'standard' vector wave equation\n",

    "#### 2) Removing the Vectorial Dependence\n",
