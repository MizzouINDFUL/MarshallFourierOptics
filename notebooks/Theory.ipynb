Without any motivation we assume the wave is propagating in a dielectric medium that is linear, isotropic, homogeneous, nondispersive, and nonmagnetic. While we wont really get into the consequences of these assumptions here, rest assured these assumptions are valid for free space propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decouple the PDEs we take the curl of Faraday's law and simplify with the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{E}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E}) - \\nabla^2 \\vec{E}$, Ampere's law, and Gauss's law assuming no charge density: \n",

Notice that we started with a system of first order coupled partial differential equations, and we have now arrived at a second order (un-coupled) partial differential equation. There is one final simplification that is typical in most textbooks. We first need to define the index of refraction $n = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}}$ and the speed of light $c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0}}$. Substituting in, we arrive at the 'standard' vector wave equation\n",

It states rather concisely that the disturbance due to a scalar field at $z=0$ is simply the inverse Fourier Transform of the Fourier Transform of the field at $z=0$ multiplied by a propagation transfer function. Fourier optics combines electromagnetics, sampling theory, and signal processing into a functional description of the wave nature of light."
